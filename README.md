# crust
Inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Lua](https://www.lua.org/start.html), [LÃ–VE](https://www.love2d.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/). A great first language and a great next language to learn after Scratch. It will introduce low level concepts such as floating point numbers and bitwise operations.
# Goals
- simplicity
> [!NOTE]
> 1. It's hard to know if something is a function or method
>  - Only functions
> 3. There are too many implicit number rules
>  - Have one integer type
>  - Have one integer type and one byte type
>  - Have a integer type which is a collective name for all integers
>  - Explicit number conversion

# Mvp
- only wasm core
- only wasi preview 1
- only integers
# Error handling
Just assertions. Avoid crashing with if statements.
# Pointers
Nope.
# Mutability
Everything is mutable.
# Memory
Memory is deallocated once a variable goes out of scope.
# Functions
All parameters are mutable references. Functions are strongly typed. Functions cannot use varibles from the outside, only their parameters. They can return mutliple values using tuples.
# Types
- We have 5 kinds of number literals. Floats `1.0`, Decimal `58`, Hexadecimal `0x4B`, Binary `0b01001011`, and Chars `'a'`.
- Chars can be any [utf-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) code point and has the samllest possible integer type out of `i8`, `i16` and `i32`.
- Integers can be any size that's an exponent of 2, `i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, i256, i512 ...`.
- floats have one size `f64` which is a 64-bit floating point number following the normal rules of [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754).
- Conversions are implicit. Use type declarations to convert between types. (`i64 x = 'a'`)
- The program crashes if the conversion is impossible. (`i8 = 923837`)
- Division always returns an `f64`. Use `div_i64()` for integer division.
- The type of an expression is the largest integer in the expression or `f64` if there is a float involved anywhere.
- Integer literals are assumed to be i64 unless given another type.
> [!NOTE]
> Hmmm... what is this trying to solve?
> Well in trivial cases such as 1 + 1.5 we don't want to be explicit about the type. And if for example using `function('a')` that conversion is implicit or when sending integers to a function taking only floats. Is there anything else? Idk. but it introduces a lot confusing sutiations when it's hard to know the static type of a variable. This is a hard call.
>
> So, it's about how we imply a type to expressions.
> It's about how we do conversion implicitly for number types in arguments to functions.
> That's it. You always have the choice to be explicit with type declarations.
# Comments
Comments start with `//`.
# Boolean Expresssions
Chained bollean expressions `0 < x <= 10` are allowed. Ambiguous expressions such as `x and y or z` are not allowed.
# `use`
The `use` keyword imports code from local files, `use stuff/functions.crs`. By default the contents are put in the top level of your file, name collisions are possible. You can give them a namespace with the `as` keyword: `use stuff/function.crs as funcs`.
